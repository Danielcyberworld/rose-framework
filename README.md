 ### A framework for developers
<br/>
I built Rose with the intention of providing a framework for those developers who prefer the atomic css style guide. Therefore, Rose consists of many tiny little modules that can apply margin, padding, color, border-width... based on the screen size. Currently, the goal is to add components like navigation, wells, dropdowns, etc., similar to those in Bootstrap. Feel free to contribute, or message me *[here](https://www.burkholderwd.com/contact)*
